    "# Justification for Hyperparameter Choices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Learning Rate (alpha)\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate (Î±) determines how quickly the Q-values are updated after each step. A value of 0.15 was chosen for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Balance Between Stability and Adaptability: A moderately high learning rate ensures that the algorithm adapts quickly to new information while avoiding instability caused by large updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Experiments: Through testing, it was observed that lower values (e.g., Î± = 0.05) led to slower convergence, while higher values (Î± > 0.3) caused Q-values to oscillate, reducing policy stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This value strikes a balance, ensuring consistent learning throughout the episodes without overly aggressive updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Discount Factor (gamma)\n",
    "\n",
    "The discount factor (Î³) determines how much importance is given to future rewards compared to immediate rewards. A value of 0.9 was selected based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-Term Optimization: A high Î³ ensures that the agent considers the long-term benefits of actions (e.g., efficiently completing tasks) rather than focusing solely on immediate rewards or penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Balancing Immediate and Future Rewards: While Î³ = 1 would fully prioritize future rewards, practical experiments showed that this led to overly cautious behavior. A slightly lower value ensures that immediate penalties (e.g., step penalties) are not entirely ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Exploration Rate (epsilon)\n",
    "\n",
    "The exploration rate (Îµ) controls how often the agent takes random actions (exploration) versus following the learned policy (exploitation). The following settings were used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial Value (epsilon = 1.0): A high initial exploration rate ensures that the agent thoroughly explores the state-action space, which is critical for avoiding local optima and ensuring robust policy learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decay Rate (epsilon_decay = 0.998): This gradual decay reduces exploration over time, allowing the agent to focus on exploiting the learned policy in later episodes. Faster decay rates (e.g., Îµ_decay = 0.95) were tested but led to premature exploitation and suboptimal policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimum Value (epsilon_min = 0.01): A small minimum ensures that the agent retains some level of exploration throughout training to avoid stagnation in the presence of unexpected states.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination of parameters allows the agent to explore effectively in early episodes while converging to an optimal policy in later stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Number of Episodes (episodes)\n",
    "\n",
    "A total of 3000 episodes was chosen to ensure sufficient training time for the agent to converge. This number balances:\n",
    "\n",
    "Convergence Needs: Fewer episodes (e.g., 1000) resulted in incomplete learning, as observed through high negative rewards in later episodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Constraints: Training for significantly more episodes (e.g., 5000) yielded diminishing returns in reward improvement while increasing computational time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Maximum Steps per Episode\n",
    "\n",
    "The limit of 200 steps per episode ensures that the agent learns to complete tasks efficiently. Longer limits (e.g., 500 steps) allowed the agent to meander without penalties, delaying convergence. A 200-step limit strikes a balance between allowing exploration and penalizing inefficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact on Learning Process and Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Early Exploration: The combination of a high initial Îµ and moderately high Î± ensures thorough exploration of the environment, capturing diverse state-action pairs for robust policy development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradual Exploitation: The decaying Îµ, coupled with Î³ = 0.9, shifts the focus to exploiting the learned policy, optimizing for long-term rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient Updates: The Î± value allows the agent to quickly refine Q-values without overshooting, ensuring stability during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These hyperparameter choices collectively enable the agent to balance exploration and exploitation, leading to improved task completion rates and reduced penalties over time."
